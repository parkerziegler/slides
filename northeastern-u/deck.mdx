# Open Source and You (and Me)

<Social />

```notes
- Hey folks, my name is Parker. I'm a software engineer at Formidable and I _luv_ open source.
- It's been a really big part of my career and my identity as a software engineer, so I thought it would be a great thing to talk about today. It's also part of what makes Formidable a real home for me.
- But I do want to start by saying...

# This talk is about all of us.

```notes
- This talk is about all of us.
- I know that sounds kind of haughty and vague, probably just what you want in an academic setting.
- But I think what I'm getting at is that when I think about open source, I think about community.

  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- I think about knowledge creation. The capacity for a lot of people with different perspectives to come together and create something profound and abstract.
- I think about transparency. This knowledge isn't hidden behind paywalls, guarded in academic journals, or locked down by corporate entities.
- I think about the possibilities for transformative learning and mastery. Open source allows for slow, incremental progress. You can contribute in ways that are small and ways that are seismic, and the process of learning can trickle through all of that.

# Open source is about more than code.

```notes
- I think it's about challenging our epistemologies and our myths.
- It's about altering the structures of who has power to create knowledge in our society (though we'll get to how it also reproduces those structures later).
- It's about making community in a world that desperatly needs it.
