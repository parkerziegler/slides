# Open Source and You (and Me)

<Social />

```notes
- Hey folks, my name is Parker. I'm a software engineer at Formidable and I _luv_ open source.
- It's been a really big part of my career and my identity as a software engineer, so I thought it would be a great thing to talk about today. It's also part of what makes Formidable a real home for me.
- But I do want to start by saying...

# This talk is about all of us.

```notes
- This talk is about all of us.
- I know that sounds kind of haughty and vague, probably just what you want in an academic setting.
- But I think what I'm getting at is that when I think about open source, I think about community.
```

import { Appear } from "mdx-deck";

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Knowledge creation.</li>
    <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Transparency.</li>
    <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Transformative learning.</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- I think about knowledge creation. The capacity for a lot of people with different perspectives to come together and create something profound and abstract.
- I think about transparency. This knowledge isn't hidden behind paywalls, guarded in academic journals, or locked down by corporate entities.
- I think about the possibilities for transformative learning and mastery. Open source allows for slow, incremental progress. You can contribute in ways that are small and ways that are seismic, and the process of learning can trickle through all of that.
```

# Open source is about more than code.

```notes
- I think it's about challenging our epistemologies and our myths.
- It's about altering the structures of who has power to create knowledge in our society (though we'll get to how it also reproduces those structures later).
- It's about making community in a world that desperatly needs it.
```

# So, how do you actually do it?

### What does contributing to open source involve?

### What makes good open source?

```notes
- With all this said, how do you actually "do" open source?
- What does contributing look like?
- What makes good open source? How can we be good community members?
```

import { Image } from "mdx-deck";

<Image src="./images/mdx-deck-pr.png" />

```notes
- You _don't_ need to know everything about a library to start contributing.
- Documentation is a great way to get going, esp. typos.
```

```notes
- Creating community resources can be super helpful.
- We often don't think that our small discoveries are helpful or matter to other folks,
but they do!
```

<Image src="./images/til.png" />

```notes
- One of my favorite projects on GitHub is called TIL by Josh Branchaud.
- It's a small collection of things he's learning on a daily basis.
- Again, your research and learning are instrumental to other people's growth - so share it!
```

```notes
- Adding tests!
- OSS maintainers don't always have the time to do these things, and they really appreciate
when folks help them out!
```

---

<Image src="./images/rlr-thanks.png" />

```notes
- Even just saying thanks or sharing your story of how an OSS project helped you can be super valuable.
- This is the kind of thing that makes OSS worth it for maintainers. Let's all be good community members.

# Let's make something together.

### Like, right now.

```notes
- Alright, so now that we've talked about doing open source, let's actually do some together, right now.
```

---

<div>
  <h2 style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Collatz Conjecture</h2>
  <ul>
    <Appear>
      <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        Take any positive integer <i>n</i>
      </li>
      <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>If even, divide by 2</li>
      <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>If odd, multiply by 3 and add 1</li>
      <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Eventually, you'll arrive at 1</li>
    </Appear>
  </ul>
</div>

```notes
- We're going to be working on a problem called the Collatz conjecture.
- It's a pretty simple conjecture â€“ start with any positive integer n.
- If n is even, divide n by 2.
- If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1.
- Eventually, all numbers will converge to 1.
```

---

### But how many calculations will that take?

### How does it vary with n?

```notes
- What we're going to graph is the number of calculations it takes for n to arrive at 1.
- We'll be using an open source project from Formidable called Victory, which allows us to do all sorts of cool data visualization using a JavaScript framework called React.
```

---

### Let's write the algorithm first!

```notes
function collatz(n, count) {
  if (n === 1) {
    return count;
  }

  if (n % 2 === 0) {
    return collatz(n / 2, count + 1);
  } else {
    return collatz(3 * n + 1, count + 1);
  }
}
```

---

### Let's generate the data!

```notes
import colltaz from "./collatz";

- iterate over the data
function generateData() {
  const data = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    const count = collatz(i, 0);
    data.push({ x: i, y: count });
  }

  return data;
}
```

---

### Let's display the data!

```notes
import { VictoryChart, VictoryScatter } from "victory";

<VictoryChart
  style={{ parent: { height: 500 } }}
  domain={{ x: [0, 1000], y: [0, 200] }}
>
  <VictoryScatter data={generateData()} />
</VictoryChart>
```

---

### Let's highligt some visual differences!

```notes
<VictoryChart
  style={{ parent: { height: 500 } }}
  domain={{ x: [0, 1000], y: [0, 200] }}
>
  <VictoryScatter
    data={generateData()}
    style={{
      data: { fill: (datum) => datum.y > 100 ? "#ff9c0d" : "#7b16ff" }
    }} />
</VictoryChart>
```
