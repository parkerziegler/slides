# Open Source and You (and Me)

<Social />

```notes
- Hey folks, my name is Parker and I'm a software engineer at Formidable.
- The title of my talk today is "Open Source and You (and Me)".
- When I began writing this talk I knew I wanted to chat about open source, because it's been such a core part of my learning and growing experience as a developer. While I say I am self taught, I actually had an astonishing number of incredible teachers online in the form of the open source community.
- And you know, I was thinkning about how to convey that experience in a talk and I thought, well first I need some some sort of catchy, kind of haughty, just-vague-enough-to-be-interesting title.

```notes
- I imagined being something like a pensive, older Dumbledore, speaking in lots of platitudes and making grand generalizations. Leaving some piece of wistful wisdom hanging about.

```notes
- But full disclosure, I'm probably more like our friend Ron here.
- The reflections I want to share with you about open source are mostly based on my experience, but I hope they can offer some degree of insight into how to get started with doing it in real life.
- And like Ron, I want to acknowledge that my experience in this community is born out of a lot of privilege, and that not everyone shares the same advantages I do in being involved with open source.
- So with all of that I said...

# I believe open source is transformative.

```notes
- I truly, truly believe that open source is a transformative force in the world.
- Open source, for me, epitomizes the best of what digital communities can create.

    </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- First and foremost, I think open source has created an entirely new paradigm for knowledge creation. It's beautiful to think of contributors shaping a piece of software from around the world, all adding in little pieces of nuance. And in that effort, people with a lot of experience as well as newcomers have the opportunity to be heard.
- Moreover, the process is transparent. This creation of knowlegde isn't hidden behind paywalls, guarded in academic journals, or locked down by corporate entities. And maintainers are often forthright about the direction a project is going.
- Open source is also an incredible place to learn. One of my goals as an engineer is to become a truly dedicated reader of code, to master code as text. There's been no way for me to do that better than by reading and working with open source.

# Open source is about more than code.

```notes
- Open source is also about more than code.
- I think it challenges a lot of the conventions we have around how we make knowledge – around the value judgments we place on certain ideas.
- Because of this, I also think open source has the capacity to change some of the power structures around how we make knowledge. But that has thus far gone largely unrealized.
- At its core, It's about making community in a world that desperatly needs it.

### What does contributing to open source involve?

### What makes good open source?

```notes
- With all this said, how do you actually "do" open source?
- What does contributing look like?
- What makes good open source? How can we be good community members?
```

import { Image } from "mdx-deck";

<Image src="./images/mdx-deck-pr.png" />

```notes
- You _don't_ need to know everything about a library to start contributing.
- Documentation is a great way to get going, esp. typos.
```

```notes
- Creating community resources can be super helpful.
- We often don't think that our small discoveries are helpful or matter to other folks,
but they do!
```

<Image src="./images/til.png" />

```notes
- One of my favorite projects on GitHub is called TIL by Josh Branchaud.
- It's a small collection of things he's learning on a daily basis.
- Again, your research and learning are instrumental to other people's growth - so share it!
```

```notes
- Adding tests!
- OSS maintainers don't always have the time to do these things, and they really appreciate
when folks help them out!
```

---

<Image src="./images/rlr-thanks.png" />

```notes
- Even just saying thanks or sharing your story of how an OSS project helped you can be super valuable.
- This is the kind of thing that makes OSS worth it for maintainers. Let's all be good community members.

# Let's make something together.

### Like, right now.

```notes
- Alright, so now that we've talked about doing open source, let's actually do some together, right now.
```

<div>
  <h2 style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Collatz Conjecture</h2>
  <ul>
    <Appear>
      <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        Take any positive integer <i>n</i>
      </li>
      <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>If even, divide by 2</li>
      <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>If odd, multiply by 3 and add 1</li>
      <li style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>Eventually, you'll arrive at 1</li>
    </Appear>
  </ul>
</div>

```notes
- We're going to be working on a problem called the Collatz conjecture.
- It's a pretty simple conjecture – start with any positive integer n.
- If n is even, divide n by 2.
- If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1.
- Eventually, all numbers will converge to 1.
```

---

### But how many calculations will that take?

### How does it vary with n?

```notes
- What we're going to graph is the number of calculations it takes for n to arrive at 1.
- We'll be using an open source project from Formidable called Victory, which allows us to do all sorts of cool data visualization using a JavaScript framework called React.
```

---

## 1. Let's write the algorithm.

```notes
function collatz(n, count) {
  if (n === 1) {
    return count;
  }

  if (n % 2 === 0) {
    return collatz(n / 2, count + 1);
  } else {
    return collatz(3 * n + 1, count + 1);
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Let's generate the data.

```notes
import colltaz from "./collatz";

- iterate over the data
function generateData() {
  const data = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
    const count = collatz(i, 0);
    data.push({ x: i, y: count });
  }

  return data;
}
```

---

## 3. Let's display the data.

```notes
import { VictoryChart, VictoryScatter } from "victory";

<VictoryChart
  style={{ parent: { height: 500 } }}
  domain={{ x: [0, 1000], y: [0, 200] }}
>
  <VictoryScatter data={generateData()} />
</VictoryChart>
```

---

## 4. Let's highligt some visual differences.

```notes
<VictoryChart
  style={{ parent: { height: 500 } }}
  domain={{ x: [0, 1000], y: [0, 200] }}
>
  <VictoryScatter
    data={generateData()}
    style={{
      data: { fill: (datum) => datum.y > 100 ? "#ff9c0d" : "#7b16ff" }
    }} />
</VictoryChart>
```
