### Don't worry, it's all G-rated.

```notes
So I know what you're probably thinking.

- A Ken Wheeler inspired talk?
- Don't worry, it's very G-rated.
- But before diving in, I should tell you a bit about myself and what I'm doing up here tonight.

![](/images/reason-basics.png)

```notes
- I really got interested in Reason in the Spring after we had an internal discussion at Formidable about technologies we thought we should invest in.
- I made this little repo, `reason-basics` that seems to have helped newcomers get going with the language.
- I want to emphasize how important it is to document our learning in the community and create resources that can help people just joining the community. Reason is great at this.
- To be a great community we need to be great teachers. Place emphasis on different learning styles.
```

---
### So let's talk about where we're headed tonight.

- What is `reason-urql`?
- GraphQL and `urql`
- Porting to Reason
- Demo
- The Testing Story ðŸ˜¬

```notes
So now that you know a bit about me, let's chat about where we're headed tonight.

- We'll first chat about what `reason-urql` actually is.
- To help explain that, I'll give a brief overview of GraphQL, and talk about what benefits `urql` adds to the GraphQL ecosystem.
- We'll then chat about writing BuckleScript bindings and how I was able to bind some of the low-level parts of the API.
- I'll finish by talking about how Reason helped me augment the `urql` API and enhance the language ergonomics.
- Along the way I'll show off parts of the API and chat a bit about testing.
```

---
### So what is `reason-urql`?
![](/images/what-is.png)

```notes
Alright, so what it `reason-urql`?

- At the top-level, these are bindings to `urql` such that we can use `urql`'s API in Reason.
```

---
If these are _bindings_, why not name it `bs-urql`?

```notes
And so you might be thinking to yourself:

> If these are _bindings_, why not name it `bs-urql`?

Well because the point of this library is to actually extend the possibilities of `urql` through the power of Reason. It's intended as a Reason-first library and is designed to support semantic Reason code to the extent possible.

- So how did this come to be?
```

---
![reason-urql pitch](/images/reason-urql-pitch.png)

```notes
Well like all good Formidable open source, it started by paying homage to Ken Wheeler.

- I first pitched the idea to Ken back in May when I was coming up on OSS time.
- Went through a whole formal proposal, Ken replied, "Hell fuckin' yeah."
```

â€“ Ken Wheeler

```notes
He literally said to me, "Don't let your dreams be memes."

- After he agreed I was like, "Oh heck, how do I do this?"
- I was really interested in Reason, but I didn't have much of a background.
```

![Reason Meme](/images/reason-meme.jpg)

```notes
I'll admit at the time, my dreams were pretty much this meme.

- I really bought into the hype of Reason.

But I was actually pretty uncertain of how to get started. So I dove into something I felt a bit more comfortable with â€“ GraphQL and React.
```

### GraphQL

- Query language for APIs
- Queries, Mutations, Subscriptions
- Robust type system

```notes
For those of you unfamiliar with GraphQL, let's do a TL;DR.

- It is a query language for APIs. Replaces REST â€“ rather than having multiple endpoints from which you request resources, there's a single endpoint.
- Your schema defines the queries, mutations, and subscriptions at that endpoint, and you write resolver functions to specify how one of these types gets translated into an interaction with a remote resource (maybe a DB, maybe another endpoint, etc.)
- It's backed by a really robust type system â€“ great for Reason!
- Let's take a brief look at the full lifecycle of a GraphQL query.
```

---
### 1. Write a Query.

```graphql
const query = `query dogs {
  dogs {
    name
    key
    breed
    likes
  }
}`;
```

```notes
We start off by writing a query. A query is basically a description of the data we want back from our API.

- The awesome thing about GraphQL is that it allows us to request _only_ the data we need.
- Can add and remove fields from queries and mutations as needed. Helps to address issues with overfetching in REST APIs.
```

---
### 2. Send the query to our API.

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(query)
});
```

```notes
Next we send our query off to our API.

- It's important to note that you can send your data in ways that you're used to. You don't need a GraphQL client.
- Pop that puppy in a `fetch` and you're off.
```

---
### 3. Schema lexing, parsing, validation, etc.

```graphql
const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    dogs: [Dog]
  }
  type Dog {
    key: String!
    name: String!
    breed: String!
    color: String!
    imageUrl: String!
    description: String!
    likes: Int!
  }
`;
```

```notes
Now, on the server side, your GraphQL query handles lexing, parsing, and validating the query against your schema. Here's an exampe schema that defines a single query, dogs, which returns an array of items of type Dog.
```

---
### 4. Execute resolver.

```graphql
const resolvers = () => ({
  Query: {
    dogs: () => // interaction with DB that returns an array of dogs,
  }
});
```

```notes
Finally, your resolvers take over.

- Resolvers basically say, given this query or mutation, perform this function to get the data requested.
- So now that we know about the lifecycle of a GraphQL query, you may be wondering...
```

---
So how does `urql` fit in?
![](/images/urql-github.png)

```notes
So how does `urql` fit into this. `urql` is a GraphQL client for React. Rather than you manually setting up your `fetch` requests, the client handles making requests for you and supplies data, loading, and error states to a render prop.

- It handles step 2 of the process outlined above.
- Has a caching mechanism under the hood to prevent unnecessary network requests.
- Aims to be a lighterweight, simpler alternative to Apollo and Relay.
- Let's take a look at how it works.
```

---
### Create a `Client` and `Provider`.
```js
const client = new Client({
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql',
});

export const App = () => (
  <Provider client={client}>
    <Home />
  </Provider>
);
```

```notes
- Start off by making creating a client instance.
- Wrap your application startup in a Provider that accepts the client as a prop.
```

---
### Write your GraphQL query (or mutation).
```js
const TodosQuery = `
  query todos {
    todo {
      title
      date
      completed
    }
  }
`;
```

```notes
- Write your GraphQL query (or mutation).
```

---
### Render UI with `Connect` (or `ConnectHoC`).
```js
const Home = () => (
  <Connect
    query={query(TodosQuery)}
    children={({ loaded, data }) => (
      !loaded ? (
        <Loading />
       ) : (
         <TodoList todos={data.todos} />
       )
    )}
  />
);
```

```notes
- Wire it up to `Connect` or `ConnectHoC`.
- Takes a render prop called `children` that provides access to information about data, errors, and the cache.
```

---
import { Appear } from 'mdx-deck'

### That's pretty sweet! But how does this work in Reason?

`reason-urql` takes 2 approaches.

<Appear>
  <p><strong>Bind</strong> the API with BuckleScript annotations.</p>
  <p><strong>Extend</strong> the API to improve ergonomics.</p>
</Appear>

---
### Create a `Client` and `Provider`.
```reason
let client = Client.make(~url="https://localhost:3000/graphql", ());

let make = (_children) => {
  ...component,
  render: _self => <Provider client ><Home /></Provider>
};
```

```notes
So to see the basic use case, let's rewrite our previous example using `reason-urql`.

- We start by creating a Client and wrapping our app startup in Provider.
```

---
### Write your GraphQL query (or mutation).
```reason
module TodosQuery = [%graphql {|
  query todos {
    todo {
      title
      date
      completed
    }
  }
|}];
```

```notes
- We write our query â€“ notice that it's a `module` and has a `graphql_ppx` annotation. We'll come back to what that is and why it's important.
```

---
### Render UI with `Connect`.
```reason
let make = (_children) => {
  ...component,
  render: _self => {
    <Connect
      query=Query.query(TodosQuery.make())
      render={result =>
        switch (result##response) {
          | Loading => <Loading />
          | Data(todos) => <TodoList todos />
        }
      }
    />
  }
}
```

```notes
And we render our UI, passing in the query!

- Notice here that `result##response` is actually a variant. More on that as well coming up.
```

---
### So this doesn't look all that different!

<Appear>
  <p><i>But then what are the benefits?</i></p>
  <p><strong>What does Reason give us that JS doesn't?</strong></p>
</Appear>

```notes
So that's pretty neat â€“ we have a full implementation of `urql` working in Reason! But you may be asking yourself, what are the actual benefits we get from using Reason? Moreover, what does Reason really get us here that JS doesn't?
```

---
### `graphql_ppx` Integration
Schema and type validation at compile-time!

![](/images/graphql_ppx.gif)

```notes
This is probably my favorite part of `reason-urql`. We bake in support for `graphql_ppx`, which is a PPX rewriter for GraphQL queries in Reason.

- It actually rewrites the compiled JavaScript to efficiently check your GraphQL queries at compile time and provide runtime response validation.
- If you attempt to access a field that is optional without handling the null or undefined case (i.e. by wrapping in an option), or try to use a field without proper type coercion, you'll get errors from the compiler.
```

---
### The `response` variant

```reason
render={(result) =>
  switch (result##response) {
    | Loading => // render loading UI
    | Data(data) => // render data UI
    | Error(error) => // render error UI
  }
}
```

```notes
Another big extension to the API is altering the response from `urql` provided in the render prop.

- Under the hood we expose a `response` value on the render prop, in addition to all of the fields that `urql`'s render prop typically provides.
- Response is a variant taking Loading, Data, and Error constructors.
```

---
### Type-safe `fetch` options

```reason
let token = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9";

let fetchOptions = Client.FetchFn(() => {
  Fetch.RequestInit.make(
    ~method_=Post,
    ~headers=Fetch.HeadersInit.make({
      "Authorization": {j|Bearer $token|j}
    }),
    (),
  );
});
```

```notes
`reason-urql` also allows users to inject fetch options, using `bs-fetch` under the hood to ensure proper typing of fetch arguments.

- It's also a variant, allowing users to pass either an instance of `Fetch.RequestInit` or a function that returns an instance of `Fetch.RequestInit`.
```

---
### So what about mutations?

```reason
/* Define a mutation module. */
module LikeDog = [%graphql {|
  mutation likeDog($key: ID!) {
    likeDog(key: $key) {
      name
      key
      breed
      likes
    }
  }
|}];
```

```notes
So now that we've seen a simple query example, let's check out mutations.

- We get the same ppx rewriting support with mutations!
```

---
### Create a mutation map.

```reason
/* Functors ftw! */
module LikeDogMutation = Mutation.Make(LikeDog);

let mutationMap = Js.Dict.empty();
Js.Dict.set(
  mutationMap,
  "likeDog",
  LikeDogMutation.mutation
);
```

```notes
`urql` does an interesting thing with mutations. It requires us to pass mutations in an object.

- This is a good opportunity to use the `Js.Dict` API.
- `urql` then actually spreads these mutations on to the argument passed to the render prop.
```

---
### Uh did you say, spreads the `mutations`?

![](/images/props-spread.png)

```notes
And you, like me, may be thinking of this piece of the ReasonReact docs that talks about props spreading not being supported in Reason.

- `urql` achieves this using intersection types in TS. We don't really have those in Reason.
- So what are we to do?
```

---
### Let `Connect` know about it.

```reason
[@bs.send]
external likeDog:
  (
    Connect.renderArgs(GetAllDogs.t, 'queryData, 'store),
    {. "key": string}
  ) =>
  unit =
  "";
```

```notes
Just let `Connect` know about it.

- This is where the beauty of BuckleScript externals comes in.
- We can get by letting Reason know that there is an additional property, called `likeDog`, on our render prop argument.
```

---
### Use the `mutation`.

```reason
<Connect
  mutation=mutationMap
  render={result => {
    <button onClick={(_e) => result->likeDog({ "key": "12345" })}>
      Mutate!
    </button>
  }}
/>
```

```notes
Now we can actually go about using it!

- Wire up the mutation to something like an `onClick` handler and you're good to go!
- So some of you may be like, cool Parker, that's rad but...
```

---
### Uh, I don't use React.

<Steve src='https://media.giphy.com/media/4HtEiJhaEKHAc/giphy.gif' />

```notes
I don't use React.

- _Does `reason-urql` have a place for me?_
```

---
### `executeQuery` and `executeMutation`

- Execute one-off queries and mutations.
- Take advantage of `urql`'s caching!

---
```reason
Client.executeQuery(~client, ~query=queryAllDogs, ~skipCache=false)
  |> Js.Promise.then_(value => {
      Js.Promise.resolve(value##data##dogs);
    })
  |> Js.Promise.catch(err => {
      Js.Promise.resolve(err);
    });
```

---
### Enough chit chat, let's see the demo!

---
### So what's the testing story?

```notes
So you might be asking yourself, what's the testing story?
```

---
### It's gettin' there.

---
![](/images/bs-jest.png)

```notes
We use `bs-jest` under the hood to do most of our unit testing.

- Testing JS bindings is kind of a wonky process.
- You're in this weird liminal space of testing JS data structures in Reason, and it's not always an easy one-to-one mapping.
```

---
```reason
test("should return a valid urql mutation string", () =>
  Expect.(
    expect(mutation->Mutation.queryGet) |> toEqual(expectedMutation)
  )
);
```
